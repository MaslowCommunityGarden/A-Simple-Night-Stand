# A Simple Night Stand

A simple open source night stand

Update: I've redrawn this as an [OnShape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/19aa1f9bfced438dd74a0325/w/64b6d5851df900e5de8cd96a/e/b9167373dc47f99821fd6f4a) document

Note from jwolter: This project was the co-winner of the Maslow Forums' Community Gardener badge on April 11, 2018.
