# A Simple Night Stand

A simple open source night stand

This was one of the first things I made and I am a little hesitant to post it because if I were to build it again I would make some improvments...but I guess that's the whole point of open source, right?

The download includes both the 3D sketchup models and svg files which can be used to generate gcode.

Note from jwolter: This project was the co-winner of the Maslow Forums' Community Gardener badge on April 11, 2018.
